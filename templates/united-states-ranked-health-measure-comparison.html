                    <p>
                        In the initial, raw health measure data that we collected, health measures were difficult to compare against each other;
                        larger numbers showed a positive outcome for some measures, but smaller numbers showed a positive outcome for other measures (see measure definitions below).
                        For clarity, we chose to visualize health measure rankings relative to other states. In our method, lower numbers mean higher rank (better performance on a given measure), 
                        and higher numbers mean lower rank (worse performance).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We hoped to visualize and establish whether any correlations appeared to warrant further investigation. For most measures, there were not any
                        clear trends we could discern. For some measures, data for high MMR states clumped together, and data for low MMR states clumped together. 
                        More in-depth data gathering and analysis would be necessary to draw stronger conclusions about the connection between any measure and MMR.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For some measures (e.g., Health Outcomes - Women) we were surprised to see that the states with
                        higher MMR scored as having the healthiest outcomes. This leads us to believe that there are
                        likely <a href="/machine-learning-race-model#main-container">other factors at play</a> that are not obvious within this limited dataset.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>It’s important to note that the rankings are a relative measure of health. Not all changes in rank translate into actual declines or improvements in health (<a href="https://www.americashealthrankings.org/about/methodology/rankings">HWC</a>).</q>
