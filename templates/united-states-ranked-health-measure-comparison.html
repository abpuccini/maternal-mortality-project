                <hr>
                <p>The five states with the highest maternal mortality rates as of the 2019 America's Healthcare
                    Rankings Health of Women and Children (HWC) report were Louisiana, Georgia, Indiana, New Jersey, and
                    Arkansas. Conversely, the five states with the lowest rates were Alaska, Massachusets, Nevada,
                    Delaware, and West Virginia. Here you can visualize the maternal mortality rates for those states
                    alongside their national rankings for potentially related factors.</p>
                <p>Use the dropdown menu to choose a ranked measure to compare with the maternal mortality rates for the
                    selected states. We chose to visualize measures from the 2019 HWC Report that we thought might show
                    interesting correlations.</p>
                <p>Aside from Maternal Mortality Rate, all measures are displayed by their ranking: "The state health
                    rankings are a composite index of state-level population health measures. Each measure is ranked by
                    the states’ values, with one being the healthiest value and 50 the least healthy value. Ties in
                    value are assigned equal ranks." <a

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <hr>
                <div id="overview">
                    <p>For some of the measures we have visualized, larger numbers were a positive thing, while for
                        others, smaller numbers were a positive thing (see measure notes below). Therefor, instead of
                        looking at the raw numbers, we chose to look at their rankings relative to other states. For
                        this method,
                        lower numbers means higher rank ('better' performance on a given measure), and higher numbers
                        means lower
                        rank ('worse' performance).</p>
                    <p>What we were hoping to accomplish with these visualizations is simply establishing if there
                        appear to be any
                        correlations or trends warranting further investigation. For many measures, there are not any
                        clear trends
                        we could discern, but for others there was some clumping, wherein the high MMR states and low
                        MMR states were
                        grouped more closely with themselves in their rankings. More in-depth data gathering and
                        analysis would be necessary
                        to draw any significant conclusions about the connection between any measure and MMR.</p>
                    <p>For some measures, like Health Outcomes - Women, we were surprised to see that the states with
                        higher MMR actually trended as lower ranked. This leads us to believe that there are
                        likely other factors at play that are not obvious within this limited dataset</p>
