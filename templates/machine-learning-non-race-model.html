                    After visualizing maternal mortality ratio (MMR) data from the United States and seeing disparities
                    among states in insurance coverage and health measures, we decided to apply machine learning to the
                    problem. It was clear from initial research that racial and ethnic disparities existed, so we
                    collected two datasets: one that utilized MMR data stratified by race, and another that included MMR
                    data for all races and also included insurance status and 26 different health measures. We then
                    trained and tested a variety of models before choosing the top-performing models for each subset of
                    data.

                <p>
                    We chose linear regression analysis, which is supervised machine learning, to create a model that
                    examines the impact of various factors on maternal mortality ratio (MMR) irrespective of race. We
                    determined correlations
                    using linear regression analyses which indicated both positive and negative relationships.

                    Based upon an initial heatmap which included all features, a second, more focused heatmap was
                    developed. In the focused heatmap pictured above, the analyses indicated that diabetes and premature
                    death
                    had the strongest positive correlations. Other important correlations included positive
                    relationships
                    with physical inactivity, obesity and low birth weight. Interestingly, medicare coverage also had a
                    moderately strong correlation with MMR. High health status, which is the percentage of women who
                    reported
                    that their health is very good or excellent, had the strongest negative correlation in addition to
                    higher
                    weighted sums of all determinants and health outcomes from the national average. Dental visits also
                    had a
                    moderately strong negative correlation with MMR.

                    than 0.20, which suggest a moderate or greater association. But removing insignificant variables did

                <hr>
                <p> Further reduction in features in our linear models resulted in a slightly lowered R-squared (0.43),
                    and
                    by examining the features with the most positive and negative correlation with MMR, depicted in the
                    figure below,
                    it was determined that the data was non-linear. So, a polynomial regression was applied and the
                    features were
                    converted into polynomial feature at degree 2. Plotting the actual MMR, the linear regression MMR
                    and
                    polynomial fit MMR demonstrated that the polynomial regression modeled the MMR relationship with the
                    variables
                    better than the linear regression model.

                <hr>
                <p>The dataset was grouped by year and the average annual MMR was calculated for
                    2009 to 2019 and then used in the time-series forecast to calculate the average predicted rates.
                    A regression was performed by year and an R-squared of 0.74 was observed. Maternal mortality rate
                    predictions were then carried out for 2020 to 2030. Maternal mortality rates increased slowly
                    from 2009 to 2019, and based on the forecast, rates continue to increase at the same pace until
                    2030. <a

                        People 2030’s goal</a> for maternal mortality rate is to reduce to 15.7
                    maternal deaths per 100,000
                    births,<a href="#HWC" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="HWC-ref"></a> however our model suggests that in this time MMR will actually increase by 25% to
                    approximately 44.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clearly, the forecast depends on the variables continuing their current trend for the next 10
                    years. But these trends can change and alter the trajectory of maternal mortality rates.
                    If rates of diabetes, which had the strongest correlation with MMR, were to decrease or even just
                    maintain due to effective interventions (e.g., change in dietary habits), then it is probable that
                    the forecasted MMR would not increase as much from 2020 to 2030. This also applies to changes in obesity
                    rates, physical inactivity, health status of women, and other factors like dental visits, all of
                    which could drastically impact MMR in the years to come.

                <p>
                    Given the nature of the data pulled, it was always more likely that a linear regression was the
                    better fit for the data, but we wanted to attempt to model a neural network as well and see if anything
                    surprising could be learned. A similar process was used to prepare the data as with the linear regressions, then a base
                    sequential model was created, and using KerasRegressor and setting loss to mean squared error,
                    various fits were explored. No matter the data portion that was input, and any number of hidden layers added, the
                    mean squared error never was seen below 1,000, which was a much worse outcome than the linear models already created.
